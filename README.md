- by Jeff Yaus

## Overview

_lei-carousel_ is a carousel component for React, designed to be lightweight and
standards-compliant.

Many carousel components are large, complex, and unwieldy.
They clone or rearrange DOM notes to create an infinite loop of slides, which
can create issues when attaching handlers to the contents of those slides. 

_lei-carousel_ instead leverages the native browser behavior for basic scrolling.
Then, when the user clicks all the way to the end of the carousel, the carousel will "rewind"
and scroll back to the beginning. This style of looping eliminates the need for cloning
or rearranging DOM nodes.

- Fast performance, using as many native browser features as possible
- Easily-customized visuals

## Usage

```
<Carousel>
  <CarouselSlide>
    content of first slide
  </CarouselSlide>
  <CarouselSlide>
    content of second slide
  </CarouselSlide>
</Carousel>
```

### Props

#### accessibleTextDot

_string_. (default: "Go to slide")
The accessible text to be added to each dot as an aria-label value; the number of the dot/slide will be appended to the end.

#### accessibleTextNext

_string_. (default: "Go to next slide")
The accessible text to be added to the Next button as an aria-label value.

#### accessibleTextPrevious

_string_. (default: "Go to previous slide")
The accessible text to be added to the Previous button as an aria-label value.

#### dots

_boolean_. (default: false)
Whether to show the indicator dots below the carousel.

#### finite

_boolean_. (default: false)
Whether the carousel is finite. With a finite carousel, when the user advances past the last
slide using the buttons, it won't scroll back to the beginning.
(Same for advancing backwards past the first slide; it won't scroll to the end.)

#### gap

_string_. (default: null)
How much of a gap to put between slides. You need to include a unit, e.g. "20px" and not "20".

#### initialSlide

_number_. (default: 1)
Which slide will be the current slide when the component initializes.

#### slidesToShow

_number_. (default: 1)
How many slides will be shown at a time. Decimals are allowed.
